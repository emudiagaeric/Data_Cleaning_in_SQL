This project, authored by **Emudiaga Rukevwe Ericson**, focuses on cleaning and preparing a company layoffs dataset sourced from Kaggle using **MySQL**.  

A blank database named `company_layoff` was created, and raw CSV data was imported for cleaning. Key steps included:  
- **Trimming inconsistencies** in company and country names.  
- **Standardizing categorical entries** (e.g., industry names).  
- **Converting date strings** to proper date formats.  
- **Handling missing values** by tagging unknown industries.  
- **Removing duplicate and irrelevant records** to ensure data accuracy.  

This workflow demonstrates practical SQL skills in real-world data preparation, showcasing the use of `UPDATE`, `CTE`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and data integrity checks.  

The cleaned dataset can now be used for advanced analysis — such as identifying factors influencing layoffs or building predictive models.
