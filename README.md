## Emudiaga Rukevwe Ericson
This project was an insightful journey. It cuts accross various SQL commands to ensure data is properly prepared for analysis. 
In this project, we engaged basic SQL commands from ```sql SELECT, WHERE, IN, LIKE, JOINS, TRIM, DATEDIFF, UPDATE, DELETE, STR_TO_DATE, ALTER, CTE, STRING FUNCTIONS, WINDOWS FUNCTION such as OVER(),PARTITION BY, ROW_NUM(), RANK() etc. ```
The final outcome is amazing
